Basic requirements:
1. **Severity** should be at the validation test level since it defines the criticality of the test itself
2. **ErrorScope** can use `ValidationScope` - no need for a separate enum
3. Virtual nodes/links (nwo_type != 101/201) need special handling

The validation tests structure is organized by criticality and scope:

1. **CONNECTIVITY Tests (CRITICAL)**: These are the most critical as they can completely break path functionality
2. **UTILITY Tests (ERROR/WARNING)**: Important for fab operations but not always critical
3. **POC Configuration (WARNING)**: Configuration issues that need review
4. **STRUCTURAL Tests (INFO/WARNING)**: Optimization and anomaly detection
5. **PERFORMANCE Tests (INFO/WARNING)**: Cost and efficiency validation
6. **SCENARIO Tests (CRITICAL/ERROR)**: Context-specific validation including contamination prevention

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Severity is at test level**: Each validation test has its inherent severity
- **No separate ErrorScope**: Uses `ValidationScope` to avoid duplication  
- **Test codes follow pattern**: `<OBJECT>_<SCOPE>_<SEQ>` for easy identification
- **Virtual node consideration**: Tests account for virtual nodes (nwo_type != 101/201)
- **AI-ready tags**: TagType and TagCode designed for machine learning training

The severity logic:
- **CRITICAL**: Breaks connectivity/causes contamination
- **ERROR**: Significant issues affecting functionality
- **WARNING**: Issues needing review but not blocking
- **INFO**: Monitoring and optimization opportunities

## Complete ValidationManager Features:

### Core Validation Framework:
- Connectivity Validation (CRITICAL): Ensures path integrity and continuity
- Utility Consistency (ERROR/WARNING): Validates utility compatibility and transitions  
- PoC Configuration (WARNING): Validates Point-of-Connection references
- Structural Analysis (INFO/WARNING): Detects anomalies and optimization opportunities
- Performance Validation (INFO/WARNING): Analyzes costs, materials, and flow directions

### Key Validation Checks:
1. PATH_CONN_001-007: Critical connectivity tests (missing nodes/links, continuity, endpoints)
2. PATH_UTY_001-004: Utility consistency and transition validation
3. PATH_POC_001-002: PoC reference and usage validation
4. PATH_STR_001-005: Structural integrity (length, complexity, loops, virtual nodes)
5. PATH_PER_001-005: Performance analysis (cost, materials, flow, data codes)

### AI Training Tags System:
- Automated tag generation based on validation results
- Confidence scoring for machine learning training
