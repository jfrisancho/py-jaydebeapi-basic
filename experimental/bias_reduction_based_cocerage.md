Based on your description, you're dealing with a classic problem in constrained random sampling where you can get stuck in local optima or hit coverage plateaus. Here are some best practices to handle this situation:

## 1. **Adaptive Termination Strategy**
Instead of just using `max_attempts_per_toolset/equipment`, implement a more sophisticated stopping condition:

```python
@dataclass
class BiasReduction:
    max_attempts_per_toolset: int = 5
    max_attempts_per_equipment: int = 3
    min_distance_between_nodes: int = 10
    utility_diversity_weight: float = 0.3
    category_diversity_weight: float = 0.2
    phase_diversity_weight: float = 0.2
    
    # New adaptive termination parameters
    plateau_threshold: int = 50  # attempts without improvement
    min_coverage_improvement: float = 0.01  # minimum improvement to reset plateau
    coverage_timeout_multiplier: float = 2.0  # increase attempts when close to target
```

## 2. **Progressive Relaxation**
When you hit a plateau, progressively relax constraints:

```python
def find_paths_with_progressive_relaxation(target_coverage=0.3):
    original_min_distance = config.min_distance_between_nodes
    attempts_without_improvement = 0
    best_coverage = 0
    
    for relaxation_level in range(3):  # Try 3 levels of relaxation
        config.min_distance_between_nodes = max(1, original_min_distance - relaxation_level * 3)
        
        current_coverage = attempt_sampling()
        
        if current_coverage >= target_coverage:
            return current_coverage
        
        if current_coverage > best_coverage + config.min_coverage_improvement:
            best_coverage = current_coverage
            attempts_without_improvement = 0
        else:
            attempts_without_improvement += 1
            
        if attempts_without_improvement > config.plateau_threshold:
            break
    
    return best_coverage
```

## 3. **Coverage-Aware Sampling Strategy**
Instead of pure random sampling, use coverage-guided sampling:

```python
def coverage_guided_sampling(current_paths, universe_nodes, universe_links):
    # Calculate uncovered nodes/links
    covered_nodes = set()
    covered_links = set()
    
    for path in current_paths:
        covered_nodes.update(path.nodes)
        covered_links.update(path.links)
    
    uncovered_nodes = universe_nodes - covered_nodes
    uncovered_links = universe_links - covered_links
    
    # Bias sampling toward paths that cover uncovered elements
    return sample_paths_with_bias(uncovered_nodes, uncovered_links)
```

## 4. **Multi-Strategy Approach**
Combine different sampling strategies:

```python
class SamplingStrategy(Enum):
    RANDOM = "random"
    COVERAGE_GUIDED = "coverage_guided"
    DIVERSITY_FOCUSED = "diversity_focused"
    HYBRID = "hybrid"

def multi_strategy_sampling(target_coverage=0.3):
    strategies = [
        SamplingStrategy.RANDOM,
        SamplingStrategy.COVERAGE_GUIDED,
        SamplingStrategy.DIVERSITY_FOCUSED
    ]
    
    for strategy in strategies:
        coverage = sample_with_strategy(strategy, target_coverage)
        if coverage >= target_coverage:
            return coverage
    
    # If all strategies fail, return best coverage achieved
    return max(coverage_results)
```

## 5. **Graceful Degradation**
Accept "good enough" coverage when perfect coverage isn't achievable:

```python
def adaptive_target_coverage(universe_size, constraints):
    # Estimate theoretical maximum coverage given constraints
    theoretical_max = estimate_max_coverage(universe_size, constraints)
    
    # Set realistic target (e.g., 90% of theoretical maximum)
    realistic_target = min(target_coverage, theoretical_max * 0.9)
    
    return realistic_target
```

## 6. **Recommended Implementation**
Here's a comprehensive approach:

```python
def find_equipment_paths(target_coverage=0.3):
    best_coverage = 0
    attempts_without_improvement = 0
    relaxation_level = 0
    
    while best_coverage < target_coverage:
        # Try current configuration
        current_coverage = attempt_sampling_with_timeout()
        
        if current_coverage > best_coverage + config.min_coverage_improvement:
            best_coverage = current_coverage
            attempts_without_improvement = 0
        else:
            attempts_without_improvement += 1
        
        # Check termination conditions
        if attempts_without_improvement > config.plateau_threshold:
            if relaxation_level < MAX_RELAXATION_LEVELS:
                relax_constraints(relaxation_level)
                relaxation_level += 1
                attempts_without_improvement = 0
            else:
                # Accept current coverage and break
                break
    
    return best_coverage, get_current_paths()
```

## Key Recommendations:

1. **Set realistic expectations**: Analyze your universe size and constraints to set achievable coverage targets
2. **Use plateau detection**: Stop when improvement stagnates rather than hitting arbitrary attempt limits
3. **Implement progressive relaxation**: Gradually relax constraints when stuck
4. **Add logging**: Track why sampling fails (constraint violations, universe exhaustion, etc.)
5. **Consider approximation**: Sometimes 0.19 coverage with good diversity is better than getting stuck

The key is to balance coverage goals with practical constraints while avoiding infinite loops through intelligent termination strategies.
