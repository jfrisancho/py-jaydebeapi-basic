Using `bitarray` is actually more efficient for coverage tracking. Here are the adapted solutions:

## 1. **Bitarray-Based Coverage Calculation**

```python
def calculate_coverage(node_coverage, link_coverage, total_nodes, total_links):
    """Calculate current coverage percentage using bitarray."""
    nodes_covered = node_coverage.count()
    links_covered = link_coverage.count()
    
    node_coverage_pct = nodes_covered / total_nodes if total_nodes > 0 else 0
    link_coverage_pct = links_covered / total_links if total_links > 0 else 0
    
    # Combined coverage (you can weight these differently)
    return (node_coverage_pct + link_coverage_pct) / 2
```

## 2. **Coverage-Guided Sampling with Bitarray**

```python
def get_uncovered_elements(node_coverage, link_coverage):
    """Get indices of uncovered nodes and links."""
    uncovered_nodes = []
    uncovered_links = []
    
    # Find uncovered nodes
    for i in range(len(node_coverage)):
        if not node_coverage[i]:
            uncovered_nodes.append(i)
    
    # Find uncovered links  
    for i in range(len(link_coverage)):
        if not link_coverage[i]:
            uncovered_links.append(i)
    
    return uncovered_nodes, uncovered_links

def coverage_guided_sampling(node_coverage, link_coverage, universe_paths):
    """Bias sampling toward paths covering uncovered elements."""
    uncovered_nodes, uncovered_links = get_uncovered_elements(node_coverage, link_coverage)
    
    # Score paths based on how many uncovered elements they contain
    path_scores = []
    for path in universe_paths:
        score = 0
        for node in path.nodes:
            if node in uncovered_nodes:
                score += 1
        for link in path.links:
            if link in uncovered_links:
                score += 1
        path_scores.append(score)
    
    # Weighted random selection based on scores
    return weighted_random_selection(universe_paths, path_scores)
```

## 3. **Efficient Coverage Update**

```python
def update_coverage(node_coverage, link_coverage, new_path):
    """Update coverage bitarrays with new path."""
    # Set bits for nodes in the path
    for node_idx in new_path.nodes:
        node_coverage[node_idx] = 1
    
    # Set bits for links in the path
    for link_idx in new_path.links:
        link_coverage[link_idx] = 1

def would_improve_coverage(node_coverage, link_coverage, candidate_path):
    """Check if adding this path would improve coverage without actually updating."""
    improvement = 0
    
    for node_idx in candidate_path.nodes:
        if not node_coverage[node_idx]:
            improvement += 1
    
    for link_idx in candidate_path.links:
        if not link_coverage[link_idx]:
            improvement += 1
    
    return improvement > 0
```

## 4. **Plateau Detection with Bitarray**

```python
@dataclass
class BiasReduction:
    max_attempts_per_toolset: int = 5
    max_attempts_per_equipment: int = 3
    min_distance_between_nodes: int = 10
    utility_diversity_weight: float = 0.3
    category_diversity_weight: float = 0.2
    phase_diversity_weight: float = 0.2
    
    # Plateau detection
    plateau_threshold: int = 50
    min_coverage_improvement: float = 0.01
    coverage_history_size: int = 10  # Track last N coverage values

class CoverageTracker:
    def __init__(self, total_nodes, total_links, config):
        self.node_coverage = bitarray(total_nodes)
        self.link_coverage = bitarray(total_links)
        self.node_coverage.setall(0)
        self.link_coverage.setall(0)
        
        self.total_nodes = total_nodes
        self.total_links = total_links
        self.config = config
        
        # Plateau detection
        self.coverage_history = deque(maxlen=config.coverage_history_size)
        self.attempts_without_improvement = 0
        self.best_coverage = 0.0
    
    def get_current_coverage(self):
        return calculate_coverage(
            self.node_coverage, 
            self.link_coverage, 
            self.total_nodes, 
            self.total_links
        )
    
    def add_path(self, path):
        """Add path and return whether it improved coverage."""
        old_coverage = self.get_current_coverage()
        update_coverage(self.node_coverage, self.link_coverage, path)
        new_coverage = self.get_current_coverage()
        
        improvement = new_coverage - old_coverage
        
        if improvement > self.config.min_coverage_improvement:
            self.best_coverage = new_coverage
            self.attempts_without_improvement = 0
        else:
            self.attempts_without_improvement += 1
        
        self.coverage_history.append(new_coverage)
        return improvement > 0
    
    def is_plateau(self):
        """Check if we've hit a coverage plateau."""
        return self.attempts_without_improvement >= self.config.plateau_threshold
    
    def get_coverage_trend(self):
        """Get recent coverage trend."""
        if len(self.coverage_history) < 2:
            return 0
        recent = list(self.coverage_history)[-5:]  # Last 5 values
        return recent[-1] - recent[0] if len(recent) > 1 else 0
```

## 5. **Complete Implementation with Bitarray**

```python
def find_equipment_paths_with_bitarray(target_coverage=0.3):
    coverage_tracker = CoverageTracker(total_nodes, total_links, config)
    selected_paths = []
    
    relaxation_level = 0
    original_min_distance = config.min_distance_between_nodes
    
    while coverage_tracker.get_current_coverage() < target_coverage:
        # Try to find a path that improves coverage
        candidate_path = None
        attempts = 0
        
        while attempts < config.max_attempts_per_equipment:
            # Use coverage-guided sampling
            if coverage_tracker.get_current_coverage() > 0.1:  # Switch strategy when we have some coverage
                candidate = coverage_guided_sampling(
                    coverage_tracker.node_coverage,
                    coverage_tracker.link_coverage,
                    universe_paths
                )
            else:
                candidate = random_sampling(universe_paths)
            
            if (candidate and 
                satisfies_constraints(candidate, selected_paths) and
                would_improve_coverage(coverage_tracker.node_coverage, 
                                     coverage_tracker.link_coverage, 
                                     candidate)):
                candidate_path = candidate
                break
            
            attempts += 1
        
        if candidate_path:
            selected_paths.append(candidate_path)
            coverage_tracker.add_path(candidate_path)
        
        # Check for plateau
        if coverage_tracker.is_plateau():
            if relaxation_level < 3:  # Max 3 relaxation levels
                # Relax constraints
                config.min_distance_between_nodes = max(1, original_min_distance - relaxation_level * 2)
                relaxation_level += 1
                coverage_tracker.attempts_without_improvement = 0
            else:
                # Accept current coverage and break
                break
    
    # Restore original configuration
    config.min_distance_between_nodes = original_min_distance
    
    return coverage_tracker.get_current_coverage(), selected_paths
```

## 6. **Performance Optimizations for Bitarray**

```python
def fast_coverage_check(node_coverage, link_coverage, path):
    """Fast check using bitarray operations."""
    # Create temporary bitarrays for the path
    path_nodes = bitarray(len(node_coverage))
    path_links = bitarray(len(link_coverage))
    
    path_nodes.setall(0)
    path_links.setall(0)
    
    # Set bits for path elements
    for node_idx in path.nodes:
        path_nodes[node_idx] = 1
    for link_idx in path.links:
        path_links[link_idx] = 1
    
    # Check improvement using bitwise operations
    node_improvement = (path_nodes & ~node_coverage).count()
    link_improvement = (path_links & ~link_coverage).count()
    
    return node_improvement + link_improvement > 0
```

The bitarray approach is actually more efficient for large universes since:
- Bitwise operations are very fast
- Memory usage is minimal (1 bit per node/link)
- Coverage calculation is O(1) with `count()`
- Set operations can be done with bitwise AND/OR operations

This should help you avoid the infinite loop while maintaining good performance!
