Given your use case â€” validating utility transitions between utility A and B for each node across 200,000 nodes and 300,000 links per path, and a mapping of ~500 utility transitions â€” the structure youâ€™ve provided is already near-optimal.

âœ… Optimal Strategy: dict[int, set[int]] lookup

This is the most efficient structure for:

O(1) lookup for A in mapping

O(1) average time for B in mapping[A]



---

âœ… Optimized Function for Lookup
```python
class UtilityValidator:
    _valid_transitions: dict[int, set[int]] = {
        42: {176, 188},
        83: {132},
        89: {141, 228},
        130: {86, 233},
        132: {83, 130, 365},
        141: {89, 228},
        176: {42, 132},
        188: {42},
        228: {89, 141},
        233: {130},
        365: {132},
    }

    @staticmethod
    def is_valid_transition(from_util: int, to_util: int) -> bool:
        """Check if a utility transition is valid in O(1) time."""
        return to_util in UtilityValidator._valid_transitions.get(from_util, set())
```

---

ðŸ§ª Usage (in your path traversal loop)
```python
if UtilityValidator.is_valid_transition(curr_util, next_util):
    # Valid transition
    ...
else:
    # Invalid utility transition
    ...
```


ðŸ§  Performance Characteristics

Operation	Time Complexity	Performance

dict.get(from_util)	O(1)	âœ… Fast
to_util in set	O(1) avg	âœ… Fast
Combined get + in lookup	O(1)	âœ… Best possible for your case


This is already the most efficient lookup mechanism in Python 3.11 for this type of validation.

ðŸš€ Further Optimizations (if really needed)

Only needed if profiling shows it's a bottleneck:

Use `@classmethod` + `__slots__` to avoid class instantiation overhead.

Precompile valid pairs into a `frozenset[tuple[int, int]]` if directionality is critical.

Use Numba if this is called inside numeric-heavy vectorized loops.

But for your current use case â€” dict of sets is optimal.
