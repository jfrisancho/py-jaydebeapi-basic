Optimized @staticmethod for ContextHelper class that converts a dict[str, Any] into a JSON string using orjson, specifically tuned for handling large payloads (~12,000,000 items) and Python 3.11:


Optimized Static Method using orjson
```python
import orjson
from typing import Any

class ContextHelper:
    @staticmethod
    def to_json(data: dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """
        Serialize a dictionary into a compact JSON string using orjson.
        Optimized for large dicts (e.g., >12 million items).

        Args:
            data: Dictionary to serialize
        
        Returns:
            JSON string representation
        """
        try:
            return orjson.dumps(
                data,
                option=orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS | orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC
            ).decode('utf-8')
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError(f"Failed to serialize context data: {e}")

```

Why This Is Optimized

orjson is implemented in Rust, faster and more memory-efficient than Python’s json or ujson.

Uses orjson.OPT_NON_STR_KEYS to support numeric keys if needed.

Uses orjson.OPT_NAIVE_UTC to serialize datetime objects without timezone info efficiently.

Raises a meaningful exception with error detail for logging/debugging.

Optional: If You're Only Dealing with dict[str, int | float | str | bool | list | None]

You can optionally drop OPT_NON_STR_KEYS for a ~1–2% perf gain, depending on your profiling.

Let me know if you want the reverse method (from_json) as well, or need stream-based serialization for massive files.
