A well-written SQL function will likely not be faster in raw execution time, but it can offer performance benefits related to network efficiency and query plan caching, at the cost of portability and maintainability.

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Python-Generated SQL (our Current Optimized Approach) | Stored Function/Procedure in SQL | Winner |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Raw SQL Execution** | The database receives a full, well-formed SQL string. The query planner optimizes this specific query. | The function contains the *exact same* SQL logic. The query planner will generate an almost identical execution plan. | **Tie** |
| **Network Traffic** | The entire SQL query string (which can be several lines long) is sent from the Python app to the database for every call. | The Python app sends a very short call: `SELECT * FROM get_links_in_scope(...)`. The heavy SQL text lives on the DB server. | **SQL Function** |
| **Query Plan Caching**| The database can cache the execution plan. However, if the query string changes slightly (e.g., the `LEFT JOIN` is sometimes there, sometimes not), it may trigger a "soft" or even a "hard" parse, re-evaluating the plan. | The plan for the SQL inside the function is almost guaranteed to be cached and reused efficiently. The database recognizes the function call and applies the cached plan with the new parameters. | **SQL Function** |
| **Maintainability** | All logic is in our Python codebase. A Python developer can see and modify everything in one place. It can be version-controlled with our application. | Logic is split between the application and the database schema. We now have to manage, version, and deploy database code (migrations) separately. | **Python** |
| **Abstraction & Reuse** | This specific logic is tied to this Python class. | The function is a reusable unit in the database. Any application (Python, Java, a reporting tool like PowerBI) with DB access can use it, ensuring consistent logic everywhere. | **SQL Function** |
| **Database Portability**| The generated SQL is fairly standard. Migrating to another database (e.g., from PostgreSQL to SQL Server) would require minimal changes to the query. | Function syntax (`CREATE FUNCTION`, parameter types, procedural language) is **highly specific** to the database vendor (PL/pgSQL, T-SQL, PL/SQL). It locks We into our current database system. | **Python** |
| **Security** | As long as We use parameterized queries (which our code does), We are safe from SQL injection. | Provides a strong security boundary. We can grant an application `EXECUTE` permissions on the function but not `SELECT` permissions on the underlying tables, preventing ad-hoc queries. | **Tie / SQL Function (slight edge)** |

### So, Should We Use an SQL Function?

**The answer depends on our priorities.**

#### Scenario 1: Stick with the Python-Generated Query (Recommended Starting Point)

This is the best choice if:
*   **Performance is already sufficient.** The optimized `UNION` query we designed will likely be very fast. The overhead of sending the text-based query is often negligible unless We are in an extreme high-throughput environment.
*   **We value maintainability.** Keeping all our application's logic within the application's codebase is simpler to manage, test, and deploy.
*   **Database portability is a concern.** If there's any chance We might migrate to a different database system in the future, avoid stored functions.

#### Scenario 2: Move to an SQL Function

This is a valid optimization step if:
*   **We need to squeeze out every last drop of performance.** In systems making thousands of these calls per second, reducing network chatter and guaranteeing query plan reuse can become significant.
*   **The same logic must be shared across multiple applications.** If a reporting tool and a background worker service both need to get links in the exact same way, a function provides a single source of truth.
*   **We have a strong database administration (DBA) team** and established processes for managing database code through migrations.

### Example: What the SQL Function Would Look Like

If We were to proceed, hereâ€™s a conceptual example using PostgreSQL syntax. Note how the logic is identical to our Python-generated query.

```sql
-- Note: This syntax is for PostgreSQL. It will differ for other databases.
-- The handling of an array/list of e2e_group_nos is vendor-specific.
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_links_in_scope(
    p_fab_no INT,
    p_model_no INT,
    p_phase_no INT,
    p_e2e_group_nos INT[] -- Use an array type for the list of groups
)
RETURNS TABLE(id BIGINT) AS $$
BEGIN
    -- This query is the same as the one we built in Python
    RETURN QUERY
    WITH filtered_nodes AS (
        SELECT n.id
        FROM nw_node n
        -- Conditionally join org_shape only if p_phase_no is provided
        LEFT JOIN org_shape sh ON sh.node_id = n.id AND p_phase_no IS NOT NULL
        WHERE
            (p_fab_no IS NULL OR n.fab_no = p_fab_no)
            AND (p_model_no IS NULL OR n.model_no = p_model_no)
            AND (p_phase_no IS NULL OR sh.phase_no = p_phase_no)
            -- Check if the array is empty or if the node's group is in the array
            AND (cardinality(p_e2e_group_nos) = 0 OR n.e2e_group_no = ANY(p_e2e_group_nos))
    )
    SELECT l.id FROM nw_link l
    WHERE l.s_node_id IN (SELECT id FROM filtered_nodes)

    UNION

    SELECT l.id FROM nw_link l
    WHERE l.e_node_id IN (SELECT id FROM filtered_nodes)

    ORDER BY id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

our Python code would then become incredibly simple:

```python
def fetch_links_in_scope_from_function(self, config: RandomRunConfig) -> list[int]:
    # Pass NULL for missing values, and handle the list of group numbers
    e2e_groups = config.e2e_group_nos or []

    sql = "SELECT id FROM get_links_in_scope(%s, %s, %s, %s)"
    params = [config.fab_no, config.model_no, config.phase_no, e2e_groups]

    results = self.db.query(sql, params)
    return [row[0] for row in results]
```

### Final Recommendation

1.  **First, implement the optimized Python-generated `UNION` query.** It solves the primary performance problem, which was the massive `IN` clause with 4 million IDs.
2.  **Benchmark it.** Measure its performance under realistic load.
3.  **Only if** We find that performance is still not sufficient, or if We have a strong architectural reason (like multi-app code reuse), should We invest the time in creating, testing, and maintaining a database function.
