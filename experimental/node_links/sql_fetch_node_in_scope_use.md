Creating a SQL function for `fetch_nodes_in_scope` is a very common pattern when you want to encapsulate complex filtering logic, ensure consistency, and potentially gain performance benefits from network efficiency and query plan caching.

The function will mirror the logic from the Python code: it will accept the same filters as parameters and contain the conditional logic to build the appropriate query.

### SQL Function Alternative (PostgreSQL Syntax)

Here is a well-structured SQL function that replicates the behavior of `_fetch_nodes_in_scope`. This example uses PostgreSQL syntax, which is powerful for handling optional parameters and arrays. Note that the syntax would need to be adapted for other database systems like SQL Server or MySQL.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_nodes_in_scope(
    p_fab_no INT,
    p_model_no INT,
    p_phase_no INT,
    p_e2e_group_nos INT[] -- Use an array type to accept a list of group numbers
)
RETURNS TABLE(id BIGINT) AS $$
BEGIN
    -- This construct allows the query planner to efficiently use indexes.
    -- The RETURN QUERY statement executes the SELECT and returns its result set.
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT
        n.id
    FROM
        nw_nodes n
    -- This LEFT JOIN is conditional. The query planner is often smart enough
    -- to ignore this join completely if p_phase_no IS NULL.
    LEFT JOIN
        org_shape sh ON n.id = sh.node_id AND p_phase_no IS NOT NULL
    WHERE
        -- For each parameter, this pattern makes the filter optional.
        -- If the parameter is NULL, the condition is true and the filter is ignored.
        (p_fab_no IS NULL OR n.fab_no = p_fab_no)
        AND (p_model_no IS NULL OR n.model_no = p_model_no)
        AND (p_phase_no IS NULL OR sh.phase_no = p_phase_no)
        -- For the array, we check if it's empty or if the node's group is a member.
        -- cardinality() gets the size of the array. ANY() checks for membership.
        AND (cardinality(p_e2e_group_nos) = 0 OR n.e2e_group_no = ANY(p_e2e_group_nos))
    ORDER BY
        n.id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

### Key Design Points of the SQL Function:

1.  **Vendor-Specific Syntax**: This uses `plpgsql`, PostgreSQL's procedural language. The array type `INT[]` and the `ANY()` and `cardinality()` functions are specific to PostgreSQL. SQL Server would use Table-Valued Parameters, and MySQL might use temporary tables or string manipulation, which is less clean.
2.  **Optional Parameters**: The `(parameter IS NULL OR column = parameter)` pattern is a standard and efficient way to handle optional filters within a single query.
3.  **Array Handling**: Using a native array parameter (`INT[]`) is far superior to passing a comma-separated string, as it's safer, cleaner, and allows the database to use indexes on the `e2e_group_no` column effectively.
4.  **Return Type**: `RETURNS TABLE(id BIGINT)` clearly defines the output schema of the function, making it easy to use in other queries or from application code.
5.  **Performance**: The database will parse, analyze, and cache the execution plan for this function. Subsequent calls with different parameters can reuse this cached plan, which can be faster than sending a new, slightly different raw SQL string every time from the application.

### Python Code Using the SQL Function

Once the function is created in your database, the corresponding Python code becomes dramatically simpler. You replace all the complex string building with a single, clean function call.

Here is how you would implement both a standard fetch and a streaming method in Python using this new function.

```python
# In your OptimizedFetcher class

def fetch_nodes_in_scope_from_function(
    self,
    config: 'RandomRunConfig'
) -> List[int]:
    """
    Fetches all node IDs within the scope by calling a dedicated SQL function.
    """
    # Use an empty list for e2e_group_nos if it's None.
    # The database driver (e.g., psycopg2) will correctly map this to an empty SQL array.
    e2e_groups = config.e2e_group_nos or []

    # The SQL is now incredibly simple and clean.
    sql = "SELECT id FROM get_nodes_in_scope(%s, %s, %s, %s)"
    params = [config.fab_no, config.model_no, config.phase_no, e2e_groups]

    results = self.db.query(sql, params)
    return [row[0] for row in results]


def stream_nodes_in_scope_from_function(
    self,
    config: 'RandomRunConfig',
    chunk_size: int = 5000
) -> Iterator[List[int]]:
    """
    Streams node IDs from the get_nodes_in_scope SQL function.
    """
    e2e_groups = config.e2e_group_nos or []
    sql = "SELECT id FROM get_nodes_in_scope(%s, %s, %s, %s)"
    params = [config.fab_no, config.model_no, config.phase_no, e2e_groups]

    # The streaming logic remains the same, but it's now calling the simple function.
    for chunk_of_rows in self.db.query_stream(sql, params, chunk_size=chunk_size):
        yield [row[0] for row in chunk_of_rows]

```

### Conclusion: Should You Use It?

*   **Pros**:
    *   **Simpler Python Code**: Moves complex SQL logic out of the application, making it easier to read and maintain.
    *   **Consistency & Reusability**: Any application or tool with database access can reuse this function, ensuring the logic is identical everywhere.
    *   **Performance**: Can be slightly faster due to reduced network traffic and guaranteed query plan caching.
    *   **Security**: Can provide an abstraction layer. You can grant permissions to execute the function without granting direct read access to the tables.

*   **Cons**:
    *   **Database Lock-In**: The function syntax is vendor-specific, making it harder to migrate to a different database system.
    *   **Split Logic**: The business logic now lives in two places (application code and database schema), which can complicate deployment and version control.

For your use case, if performance is critical and the filtering logic is stable and central to your application, creating an SQL function is a very strong and professional choice.
