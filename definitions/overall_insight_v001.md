Path Validation and Coverage Analysis in Large-Scale Networks

Introduction

In the process of validating connectivity paths within a large network, such as those found in semiconductor facilities, we face numerous challenges and learning opportunities. This document outlines our approach, the validation techniques we use, and the insights gained from this incremental process.

Process Overview

1. Sampling and Path Discovery

We randomly select two points of contact (POCs) from different pieces of equipment within a selected toolset.

If no connectivity path is found, we flag the attempt for further review rather than discarding it.


2. Incremental Validations

Connectivity Validation: We ensure that all nodes and links in the path are correctly sequenced and exist in the database. This helps us identify missing or incorrect data.

Utility Consistency Validation: We check that the utility remains consistent along each segment of the path until it encounters equipment that can change or mix utilities.


Purpose and Value of the Tool

The main goal is not just to confirm "valid" paths but to uncover anomalies and critical issues. By using a random sampling approach, we can detect unusual patterns and situations that might otherwise be overlooked.

Over time, this incremental process allows us to build a robust database of both normal and abnormal findings, which can later be used to refine our validations and potentially train AI models.


Lessons Learned

Complexity of Random Sampling: While random sampling helps in discovering unexpected issues, it requires careful biasing and rules to ensure meaningful data collection.

Optimization: Working with massive datasets means always thinking about efficiency, minimizing loops, and maximizing code reusability.

Incremental Improvement: This process is incremental, and as we gather more data, we can add more validations, refine our rules, and improve our ability to distinguish between false positives and real issues.


Future Directions

As we collect more metadata, such as equipment types, flow directions, and more detailed attributes, we can further enhance our validation techniques.

This data can eventually support simulations and AI tools, helping to predict and prevent issues before they arise.
